\title{Calculate cluster medians}
\usage{
calcMedians(d_se)
}
\arguments{
\item{d_se}{Data object from previous steps, in
\code{\link[SummarizedExperiment]{SummarizedExperiment}} format, containing cluster
labels as a column in the row meta-data (from \code{\link{generateClusters}}).}
}
\value{
\code{\link[SummarizedExperiment]{SummarizedExperiment}} object, where rows =
  clusters, columns = samples, sheets ('assay' slots) = markers.
}
\description{
Calculate cluster medians (median expression of each marker for each cluster-sample
combination)
}
\details{
Calculate median expression of each marker for each cluster-sample combination.

The data object is assumed to contain a vector \code{is_marker_col} in the column
meta-data (see \code{\link{prepareData}}), which indicates whether each column
represents a marker. Cluster medians are calculated for these columns.

The cluster medians are required for the differential expression tests and plotting of
results.

Results are returned as a new \code{\link[SummarizedExperiment]{SummarizedExperiment}}
object, where rows = clusters, columns = samples, sheets ('assay' slots) = markers.
Note that there is a separate table of values ('assay') for each marker.
